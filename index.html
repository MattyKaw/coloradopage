            Learn about my experience in Colorado!
        </h3>
        <p>This small project page is dedicated to my favorite state in USA! After living 
            in Colorado I can easly say that this is second place after my homeland where 
            I could live in. There's a reason why people living here tend to be more happy.
            I gathered here information from different sites as well as from my own experience,  
            that I think might be interesting.

        <h2 class=Colorado-state>Colorado State</h2>
        <p>Colorado is notable for its diverse geography, which includes alpine mountains, 
            high plains, deserts with huge sand dunes, and deep canyons. The summit of Mount 
            Elbert at 14,440 feet (4,401.2 m) elevation in Lake County is the highest point in 
            Colorado and the Rocky Mountains of North America. Colorado is the only U.S. 
            state that lies entirely above 1,000 meters elevation. The point where the Arikaree 
            River flows out of Yuma County, Colorado, and into Cheyenne County, Kansas, is the 
            lowest point in Colorado at 3,317 feet (1,011 m) elevation. This point, which is the 
            highest low elevation point of any state, is higher than the high elevation 
            points of 18 states and the District of Columbia. he climate of Colorado is more complex 
            than states outside of the Mountain States region. Unlike most other states, southern 
            Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado. Most of Colorado is made up of 
            mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands.
